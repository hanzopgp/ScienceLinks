>This is a list of links I want to keep, channels I follow on youtube, books I've read. I want to share those in case someone is looking for informations.
<br>This list will mostly contains science stuff, mainly maths, physics and computer science. I've bought a VR headset so I'm also really into VR technologies nowadays.
<br>Feel free to add some links in this list.
